## Description

Plain Old Android News: A basic Android application for viewing the latest news from various news sources using the News API service.

This application was built using only pure Android code as an experiment, with the goal of building a basic Android application with absolutely no reliance on any dependencies, external libraries, or APIs with minimum SDK restrictions higher than API 1 (i.e. AsyncTask, Fragments, etc.) commonly found in modern Android development. As a result, this application is compatible with devices running Android API 1 - 25+.
